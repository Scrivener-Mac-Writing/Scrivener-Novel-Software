Scrivener is a professional-grade writing application developed by Literature & Latte to help authors, researchers, and content creators manage complex writing projects. It supports a wide range of document types including novels, scripts, academic papers, and more.

Unlike standard word processors, Scrivener offers a unique project-based approach. You can store research, character sketches, and reference materials within the same project file. The built-in corkboard and outliner allow you to visualize and restructure your work effortlessly.

The software includes powerful composition modes, such as full-screen writing and typewriter scrolling, to help you maintain focus. With advanced export options, you can compile your work into print-ready manuscripts, eBooks, or formatted scripts.

Scrivener is optimized for performance and reliability on modern operating systems. It integrates seamlessly with cloud services like Dropbox for easy synchronization across devices. Whether you're working on a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or desktop Mac, Scrivener delivers a smooth and responsive experience.

Its flexibility and depth make it the go-to choice for writers who need more than a basic text editor.
